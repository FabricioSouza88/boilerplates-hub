# 🔥 boilerplates-hub

**boilerplates-hub** is a centralized repository that hosts a collection of pre-configured API starters, designed to streamline and accelerate backend development across multiple languages and frameworks.

The main idea is to provide solid, ready-to-use foundations for creating modern APIs with best practices already in place — saving time and improving consistency across projects.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

To deliver production-ready, extensible API boilerplates that reduce project setup time and promote standardized, clean architecture across different tech stacks.

---

## 📦 Supported Technologies

The `boilerplates-hub` currently includes starters for:

- ✅ **.NET (C#)** — ASP.NET Core 8 API with JWT auth, Swagger, Docker, xUnit tests
- ✅ **Java** — Spring Boot 3 API with JPA, Swagger/OpenAPI, JUnit tests
- ✅ **Python** — FastAPI API with JWT auth, Docker, Pytest
- ✅ **Kotlin** — Ktor or Spring Boot Kotlin DSL API (in progress)

---

## 🧰 Common Features Across Starters

Each starter includes:

- ✅ Clean and extensible folder structure
- ✅ Global error handling middleware
- ✅ JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization
- ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI configured
- ✅ Structured logging (ILogger, Serilog, Logback, etc.)
- ✅ Docker and Docker Compose setup
- ✅ Scripts for local build and run
